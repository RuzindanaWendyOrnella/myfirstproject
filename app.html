                    Dear Picturesque:<br />

                    Ok, so I have been with the site for quite some <br />
                    time and then -- what an experience! I met the <br />
                    most incredible woman. I fell in love and so did <br />
                    she. Our relationship hit us both like an <br />
                    earthquake -- but in a great way! We have been<br />
                    attached as if we were meant to be together<br />
                    from the moment life began for each of us. We <br />
                    have so much in common and she is without a<br />
                    doubt the most gorgeous, funny, exciting, <br />
                    fabulous woman I have ever met in my entire <br />
                    life. I am writing this to just say thank you SO <br />
                    MUCH. Your site brought me so much more<br />
                    happiness than I ever dreamed possible. I should <br />
                    add that she found me. She contacted me on the<br />
                    site even though neither one of us had a picture<br />
                    posted. She was straight forward and absolutely<br />
                    honest from day 1. If she hadn't taken the first<br />
                    step I would never have fallen in love.<br />
                    PS . To the men out there on the site. I am telling<br />
                    the absolute truth and this is a totally unsolicited
                    response. My girl is stunning. When I<br />
                    drove to see her ( she lives 254 miles from me )<br />
                    we arranged to meet in the lobby bar where I
                    <br />
                    was staying. When she walked in to meet me<br />
                    there must have been 50 men in the room and <br />
                    the room went silent -- she is that beautiful.<br />
                    While I had seen her picture (and not on the site I
                    might<br />
                    add), no picture could have done her <br />
                    justice. My lady is a 6 foot super- model. She is <br />
                    brilliant, funny, exciting and now my best friend <br />
                    and lover forever. We had dinner again last night <br />
                    and everywhere we go men and woman stop to stare at her
                    . My experiences with her are like a<br />
                    dream -- a dream only for us. I wish you all the <br />
                    best. This site works! And did I mention she is the<br />
                    nicest and sweetest woman I have ever met. We <br />
                    are living proof that miracles can happen. <br />
                    Regards,<br />
                    Eric S.<br />
